# PyTorch with DirectML Samples <!-- omit in toc -->

DirectML acceleration for PyTorch is currently available for Public Preview. PyTorch with DirectML enables training and inference of complex machine learning models on a wide range of DirectX 12-compatible hardware.

DirectML is a high-performance, hardware-accelerated DirectX 12 library for machine learning. DirectML provides GPU acceleration for common machine learning tasks across a broad range of supported hardware and drivers, including all DirectX 12-capable GPUs from vendors such as AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm.

More information about DirectML can be found in [Introduction to DirectML](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-intro).

PyTorch on DirectML is supported on both the latest versions of Windows 10 and the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about), and is available for download as a PyPI package. For more information about getting started, see [GPU accelerated ML training (docs.microsoft.com)](http://aka.ms/gpuinwsldocs)
