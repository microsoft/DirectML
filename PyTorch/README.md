# PyTorch with DirectML Samples <!-- omit in toc -->

For detailed instructions on getting started with PyTorch with DirectML, see [GPU accelerated ML training](http://aka.ms/gpuinwsldocs).

## Samples

Currently 1 sample model is included in this repo to help you get started. The sample includes both inference and training scripts, and you can either train the models from scratch or use the supplied pre-trained weights.

* [squeezenet - a small image classification model](./squeezenet)
* [resnet50 - an image classification model](./resnet50)
* *more coming soon*
