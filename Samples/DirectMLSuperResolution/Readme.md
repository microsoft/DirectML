description: This sample demonstrates the DirectML API by implementing a super-resolution machine learning (ML) model on the GPU. This includes converting between image and tensor formats, initializing and executing ML operators, and interleaving graphics and ML work. The ML model performs a smart upscale of an image to double its original resolution. For example, it can scale a 540p image to 1080p.
